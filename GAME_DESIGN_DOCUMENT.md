## Game Overview

### Vision Statement
*Stellar Legacy* is a generational space civilization game where players guide humanity across the stars, managing not just resources and technology, but the evolution of human culture and society itself across hundreds of years of space travel.

### Genre
- **Primary**: Grand Strategy / Civilization Management
- **Secondary**: Narrative-Driven / Dynasty Management
- **Platform**: Web-based (Browser)

### Target Audience
- Strategy game enthusiasts who enjoy deep, long-term planning
- Players interested in narrative-driven experiences
- Fans of science fiction and space exploration themes
- Those who appreciate games with meaningful choices and consequences

### Core Experience
Players begin as the leader of a generation ship carrying thousands of humans on a multi-century journey to a distant star system. Unlike traditional 4X games, the focus is on **internal civilization management** rather than external conquest, emphasizing the delicate balance between preserving humanity's essence and adapting to the harsh realities of deep space.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Generational Impact
Every decision resonates across generations. A choice made in year 50 may have profound consequences in year 200. Players must think beyond immediate gains and consider long-term cultural and social implications.

### 2. Human Drama at Scale
While managing thousands of people, the game maintains focus on individual families, dynasties, and personal stories that give emotional weight to large-scale decisions.

### 3. Ideological Tension
Three philosophical factions (Legacies) represent different approaches to humanity's survival, creating constant tension between preservation, adaptation, and freedom.

### 4. Meaningful Consequences
Every major choice branches the narrative and civilization development in permanent ways. There are no universally "correct" answersâ€”only different paths with unique challenges.

### 5. Cultural Evolution
Society itself becomes a gameplay element that changes over time, influenced by player decisions, random events, and the unique pressures of generation ship life.

## Cultural Evolution

### Baseline Drift Concept
Human culture naturally evolves over centuries. The game tracks how far society has drifted from Earth-normal humanity across multiple dimensions:
- Social structures
- Value systems
- Behavioral norms
- Communication patterns

- Educational systems
- Religious/spiritual beliefs

### Cultural Pressure Points

#### Generational Gaps
Each new generation grows up in space, creating natural drift from Earth culture:
- Different survival priorities
- Unique space-born perspectives
- Questioning of "old world" values
- Novel social arrangements

#### Environmental Pressures
The ship environment creates unique cultural evolution:
- Resource scarcity ethics
- Closed-loop society dynamics
- High-stakes decision culture
- Communal vs. individual rights balance

#### Crisis-Driven Changes
Major crises can cause rapid cultural shifts:
- Emergency powers normalization
- Survival-first mentality adoption
- Religious or spiritual movements
- Radical social restructuring

### Cultural Intervention Systems

#### Preservation Measures

- Social stability restoration

### Long-Term Cultural Outcomes
Different cultural paths lead to distinct civilization types:
- **Traditional Humanity**: Close to Earth baseline
- **Adapted Humanity**: Evolved but recognizably human
- **Neo-Humanity**: Significantly transformed but stable
- **Fragmented Humanity**: Multiple distinct sub-cultures
- **Lost Humanity**: Unrecognizably changed from baseline
