## Generational Ship Mission Concept

### Core Vision: Knights of Sidonia Inspiration

Based on the seed ship Sidonia concept:
- **Scale**: Massive vessels housing 20,000-50,000+ population
- **Duration**: Multi-generational missions (100-500 years)
- **Purpose**: Long-range colonization, resource extraction, exploration
- **Society**: Enclosed ship-based civilization with unique cultural evolution
- **Threats**: External hazards, internal faction conflicts, resource scarcity

### Three Sect System Architecture

#### 1. The Preservers (Traditional Branch)
- **Philosophy**: Maintain original Earth culture and technology
- **Core Dilemma**: **Stability vs Stagnation** - Constant tension between preserving traditions and adapting to survive
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - **Tradition Points**: Earned by maintaining cultural practices, lost by forced adaptations
  - **Cultural Schisms**: Major events force choice between tradition and survival
  - **Knowledge Vaults**: Preserve Earth's history but risk becoming museums instead of living cultures
- **Gameplay Loop**: Manage crises where old solutions may not work, forcing painful cultural evolution
- **Ship Focus**: Earth-replica habitats with traditional governance systems
- **Population**: 40% of missions, 15,000-20,000 people per ship

#### 2. The Adaptors (Progressive Branch)
- **Philosophy**: Embrace genetic modification and technological evolution
- **Core Dilemma**: **Evolution vs Humanity** - Push boundaries while maintaining human identity
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - **Mutation Events**: Random genetic changes that can be beneficial or catastrophic
  - **Body Horror Risks**: Failed modifications create social outcasts and ethical dilemmas
  - **Innovation Cascades**: Breakthroughs can fracture society between enhanced and unenhanced
  - **Purity Factions**: Internal conflicts over how far to push human evolution
- **Gameplay Loop**: Make risky modification choices that can revolutionize or destroy your society
- **Ship Focus**: Bio-integrated vessels that evolve with their inhabitants
- **Population**: 35% of missions, 12,000-18,000 people per ship

#### 3. The Wanderers (Nomadic Branch)
- **Philosophy**: Eternal journey without destination - survival itself is the purpose
- **Core Dilemma**: **Freedom vs Extinction** - Maintain independence while avoiding gradual decline
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - **Scarcity Spirals**: Constant resource shortages requiring creative solutions
  - **Piracy Dilemmas**: Raid other ships for survival or maintain moral code and risk death
  - **Existential Dread**: Population slowly loses hope without a destination
  - **Fleet Dynamics**: Multiple smaller ships that can split or merge based on resources
- **Gameplay Loop**: Make hard choices about raiding, trading, and rationing to survive indefinitely
- **Ship Focus**: Modular fleets designed for perpetual travel and resource scavenging
- **Population**: 25% of missions, 8,000-15,000 people across 3-5 ships

- **Pyrrhic Success**: Colony exists but at massive human/cultural cost (30-59% survival)
- **Mission Failure**: Colony fails, survivors return or are lost (<30% survival)

#### Resource Extraction Missions
- **Complete Success**: Target resources extracted, ship returns with 200%+ investment return
- **Partial Success**: Some resources gained, profitable but below expectations (150-199%)
- **Break Even**: Mission costs covered but minimal profit (100-149%)
- **Mission Failure**: Resources lost, ship damaged or destroyed (<100% return)

#### Exploration Missions
- **Complete Success**: Major discoveries, new tech/worlds/allies found, all objectives met
- **Partial Success**: Some discoveries made, partial objective completion
- **Limited Success**: Minimal discoveries, survival but little gain
- **Mission Failure**: Ship lost, crew dead/stranded, no discoveries returned

### Sect-Specific Failure States

#### Preservers: Cultural Collapse
- **Trigger**: Tradition Points fall below critical threshold
- **Effect**: Society fragments, loses historical knowledge, becomes generic colonists
- **Recovery**: Extremely difficult, requires cultural renaissance events

#### Adaptors: Humanity Loss
- **Trigger**: Too many failed mutations or enhancement-related social fractures
- **Effect**: Population splits into incompatible subspecies, civil war
- **Recovery**: Possible through careful genetic counseling and social programs

#### Wanderers: Fleet Dissolution
- **Trigger**: Resources drop below survival threshold or fleet ships become isolated
- **Effect**: Individual ships go rogue, become pirates, or simply disappear
- **Recovery**: Nearly impossible once ships scatter

### Long-Term Civilization Stakes
- **Golden Age**: Multiple successful missions create technological/cultural renaissance
- **Dark Age**: String of failures leads to societal regression and isolation
- **Extinction Event**: Critical mission failures can end entire sect branches
