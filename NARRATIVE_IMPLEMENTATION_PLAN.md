## Core Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Chronicle System Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

#### 1.1 Chronicle Data Structures
Create new TypeScript types to capture mission outcomes and persist them across campaigns:

```typescript
interface ChronicleEntry {
  missionId: string;
  missionName: string;
  completedYear: number;
  realWorldDate: Date;
  
  // Mission Outcome
  successLevel: 'complete' | 'partial' | 'pyrrhic' | 'failure';
  dominantLegacy: LegacyTypeType;
  populationOutcome: 'thrived' | 'survived' | 'diminished' | 'extinct';
  
  // Major Decisions
  keyDecisions: ChronicleDecision[];
  
  // Final State
  finalResources: Partial<ExtendedResources>;
  culturalDeviation: Record<LegacyTypeType, number>;
  legacyRelationships: LegacyRelation[];
  
  // Artifacts Created
  artifacts: ChronicleArtifact[];
  discoveries: string[];
  
  // Colony/Settlement Outcome
  settlementResult: SettlementResult | null;
}

interface ChronicleDecision {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  year: number;
  choice: string;
  consequences: string[];
  affectedLegacies: LegacyTypeType[];
  impact: 'minor' | 'moderate' | 'major' | 'civilization-defining';
}

interface ChronicleArtifact {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'technology' | 'cultural' | 'genetic' | 'historical';
  description: string;
  legacy: LegacyTypeType;
  effects: HeritageModifier[];
}

interface SettlementResult {
  name: string;
  location: string;
  populationType: 'pure-human' | 'adapted' | 'hybrid' | 'neo-human';
  culturalType: 'preserver' | 'adaptor' | 'wanderer' | 'hybrid';
  status: 'thriving' | 'struggling' | 'isolated' | 'lost' | 'transformed';
  influence: number; // How much this settlement affects future missions
}
```

#### 1.2 Chronicle Persistence
- Extend Zustand store with chronicle management
- Create `ChronicleService` for reading/writing campaign history
- Implement export/import functionality for sharing chronicles
- Add chronicle visualization in Legacy tab

#### 1.3 Heritage Modifiers System
Transform chronicle entries into gameplay modifiers for new missions:

```typescript
interface HeritageModifier {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  source: string; // Which chronicle entry created this
  
  // Mechanical Effects
  resourceModifiers: Partial<ExtendedResources>;
  populationModifiers: PopulationModifier[];
  eventModifiers: EventModifier[];
  
  // Narrative Effects
  startingNarrative: string;
  availableChoices: string[];
  restrictedActions: string[];
}

interface PopulationModifier {
  cohortType: CohortTypeType;
  effectType: 'bonus' | 'penalty' | 'trait';
  magnitude: number;
  description: string;
}

interface EventModifier {
  eventCategory: EventCategoryType;
  probability: number; // Multiplier for event occurrence
  outcomeModifier: number; // Bonus/penalty to specific outcomes
}
```

### Phase 2: Legacy Deck System (Weeks 4-6)

#### 2.1 Dynamic Event Cards
Create a card-based system where each Legacy builds a unique deck based on chronicle history:

```typescript
interface LegacyCard {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'event' | 'bonus' | 'crisis' | 'opportunity';
  legacy: LegacyTypeType;
  
  // Card Content
  title: string;
  description: string;
  flavorText: string;
  
  // Gameplay Effects
  triggerConditions: CardTrigger[];
  effects: CardEffect[];
  choices: CardChoice[];
  
  // Chronicle Integration
  originChronicle: string | null; // Which chronicle entry created this card
  rarityModifier: number; // How likely to appear
  
  // Metadata
  generationsActive: number;
  timesPlayed: number;
  playerRating: number; // Player can rate cards for future weighting
}

interface CardTrigger {
  condition: string; // e.g., "population_below_10000", "year_greater_than_100"
  probability: number;
  requiredPhase: MissionPhaseType | null;
}

interface CardEffect {
  target: string; // What's affected
  magnitude: number;
  duration: 'instant' | 'temporary' | 'permanent';
  description: string;
}

interface CardChoice {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  requirements: string[];
  effects: CardEffect[];
  chronicleConsequence: string; // How this choice affects future chronicles
}
```

#### 2.2 Deck Building Logic
- Algorithm to convert chronicle entries into new cards
- Balancing system to ensure variety while maintaining narrative coherence
- Player curation tools (disable unwanted cards, rate favorites)
- Legacy-specific deck themes and mechanics

#### 2.3 Card Integration
- Event system integration for card triggering
- UI components for card display and interaction
- Chronicle tracking of card outcomes for future deck evolution

### Phase 3: Three-Layer Pacing System (Weeks 7-9)

#### 3.1 Pacing State Machine
Implement dynamic pacing that adapts based on mission phase and player engagement:

```typescript
interface PacingState {
  currentPhase: 'early' | 'mid' | 'late';
  phaseYear: number; // Years into current phase
  eventDensity: number; // Events per game year
  timeAcceleration: number; // How fast years pass in real time
  
  // Player Engagement Metrics
  lastInteraction: number;
  decisionsMade: number;
  automationLevel: number;
  
  // Narrative Pulse
  nextMilestoneYear: number;
  milestoneType: 'authored' | 'emergent';
  tensionLevel: number; // 0-100, affects event severity
}

interface PacingRules {
  phaseTransitions: PhaseTransition[];
  eventDensityCurve: DensityPoint[];
  milestoneSchedule: MilestoneSchedule[];
  emergencyBrakes: EmergencyBrake[]; // Prevent runaway automation
}

interface PhaseTransition {
  fromPhase: 'early' | 'mid' | 'late';
  toPhase: 'early' | 'mid' | 'late';
  triggerYear: number;
  triggerConditions: string[];
  narrative: string;
}
```

#### 3.2 Authored Milestones vs. Emergent Drama
Balance scripted story beats with player-driven narrative:

```typescript
interface AuthoredMilestone {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phase: 'early' | 'mid' | 'late';
  triggerYear: number;
  
  // Narrative Content
  title: string;
  description: string;
  context: string; // References to previous decisions/outcomes
  
  // Player Choices
  choices: MilestoneChoice[];
  consequences: MilestoneConsequence[];
  
  // Chronicle Impact
  chronicleWeight: number; // How much this affects future missions
}

interface EmergentEvent {
  id: string;
  sourceSystem: 'dynasty' | 'legacy' | 'population' | 'external';
  emergenceFactors: string[]; // What conditions led to this event
  adaptiveNarrative: string; // Dynamically generated based on current state
}
```

#### 3.3 Time Acceleration & Player Control
- Intelligent time skipping during stable periods
- Player override controls for pacing preferences
- Crisis detection that automatically slows time
- Generation transition ceremonies as natural pause points

### Phase 4: Decision History & Consequence Visibility (Weeks 10-11)

#### 4.1 Decision Ledger
Track all significant player choices and their cascading effects:

```typescript
interface DecisionLedger {
  entries: DecisionEntry[];
  consequenceChains: ConsequenceChain[];
  playerReflections: PlayerReflection[];
}

interface DecisionEntry {
  id: string;
  year: number;
  generation: number;
  decision: string;
  context: string;
  alternativeChoices: string[];
  
  // Immediate Effects
  immediateConsequences: string[];
  resourceChanges: Partial<ExtendedResources>;
  
  // Long-term Tracking
  longTermConsequences: LongTermConsequence[];
  chronicleImpact: number; // How much this decision shapes the chronicle
}

interface ConsequenceChain {
  originDecisionId: string;
  chainEvents: ChainEvent[];
  stillActive: boolean;
  finalOutcome: string | null;
}

interface ChainEvent {
  year: number;
  description: string;
  severity: 'minor' | 'moderate' | 'major';
  references: string[]; // References to original decision
}
```

#### 4.2 Reference System
- Smart narrative text that dynamically references past decisions
- Visual timeline showing decision cascades
- "What if" speculation for major decision points
- Player journaling system for reflection and notes
